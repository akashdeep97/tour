	<h1>SRINAGAR</h1>
	<p><img src="images/Srinagar1.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
   <h3><p>Srinagar, the summer seat of the government of the state of Jammu and Kashmir has long been one of India창s most popular tourist destinations.
   In part, this has had to do with the multi-layered character of the city and its several attractions. And in part, this is because Srinagar serves as the
   base for the numerous places of interest and immense natural beauty that lie within Kashmir 창 and for most places, this remains the access point. Up to
   India창s Independence in 1947, only the cream of the country traveled and holidayed in Kashmir. Then, within a few short years, there was a boom in tourism
   and this soon became the backbone of Srinagar창s economy and thousands of visitors thronged to the valley of which the Mughal Emperor, Jehangir is said to
   have remarked in the seventeenth century, "Agar Firdaus bar rue zameen ast, Hamin ast-o, hamin ast-o, hamin ast" - If there is a Paradise on earth, it is
   here, it is here, it is here. Srinagar is built on both sides of the river, Jhelum. The old city has quite a different character to the wide spaces of the
   parks and boulevards and gives expression to the phrase 창cheek by jowl창; this part of the city with narrow streets and houses of exposed brick and elaborate
   timberwork 창 which includes half a dozen old bridges 창 is also the area where many craftsmen live and work; this includes most, if not all of the city창s
   copper workers. Srinagar, which lies in a valley, changes its character with every season.

   It gets snow-laden winds coming down from the hills fairly early in winter. The lakes practically freeze over and yet, some of the iconic houseboats
   tethered to the icy banks still function. The famous chinar trees and boulevards lined by poplars are stripped clean of their leaves and before rain and
   snow firmly hush them, they make for a remarkably noisy carpet that rustles and crunches at every step. The inner architecture and scaffolding of these
   magnificent trees now comes up for display with proud trunks and wiry branches. People move about with 'kangris' with clay bowls and frames of wicker,
   that hold smoldering bits of charcoal under heavy 'phirans', warm long tunics. In summer, Srinagar gets fairly hot and temperatures can touch 38 degrees
   Celsius. The numerous parks become the venue for evening promenades.

   <h3><p>On an Indian holiday, you can창t miss out the capital city, Delhi, a potpourri of cultures, traditions, architecture, and human diversity. Located on the
   banks of river Yamuna, the city has been the capital of many empires, has been destroyed and rose again to prominence each time. Old Delhi got some of its
   landmark monuments such as Red Fort, Humayun창s Tomb and Jama Masjid, from the Mughal rulers.

   Amble down the meandering lanes of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi and shop for spices, traditional apparel, colorful glass bangles, silver trinkets and
   intricate gold jewelry. Emerge into the leafy boulevards of central Delhi, dotted with works of Mughal and Victorian architecture, sprawling old mansions
   and the famous India Gate.

   Go on a boat ride or wildlife safari with our West Bengal packages in the vast mangrove forest, called Sundarbans, where you can spot tigers, dolphins and
   saltwater crocodiles. Similarly, you may spot an endangered one-horned rhino in the Dooars grasslands. One of the best places to beat the summer heat or

   explore the hordes of trekking trails through the mountains. Staying at a plush hotel or a comfortable lodge, overlooking Mount Kanchenjunga, will surely
   relieve you all stress.
