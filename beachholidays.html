<h1>KANYAKUMARI</h1>
<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
<h3><p>Located at the southernmost part of India, Kanyakumari with its beautiful beaches, Vivekananda Memorial and the
	 perfect sunset is one of the most exotic places to go in India.

Possibly amongst one of the most exotic destinations in India, Kanyakumari, is filled with attractions that do not cease to
 amaze you. You can find temples, churches, religious pillars and statues everywhere to keep you fascinated. The mixed
 culture of the place is reflected in the art, architecture and even in the local cuisine. If you are a history buff,
 you can undertake an excursion to the Kumari Amman Temple or to the Vattakottai Fort that stands erect even today.
 And if you wish to chill out at a seashore, Sanguthurai Beach, Sothavilai Beach amongst plenty others on the coastline
 are exotic and the perfect place to spend the evening. The wax museum is a different yet equally alluring hotspot for
 vacationers and is worth a visit.

 <h1>KOVALAM</h1>
 <p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
 <h3><p>Kovalam is an internationally renowned beach with three adjacent crescent beaches. It has been a favourite haunt of
	 tourists since the 1930s. A massive rocky promontory on the beach has created a beautiful bay of calm waters ideal for sea
	 bathing.

The leisure options at this beach are plenty and diverse. Sunbathing, swimming, herbal body toning massages, special cultural
 programmes and catamaran cruising are some of them. The tropical sun acts so fast that one can see the faint blush of coppery
 tan on the skin in a matter of minutes. Life on the beach begins late in the day and carries on well into the night.
 The beach complex includes a string of budget cottages, Ayurvedic health resorts, convention facilities, shopping zones,
 swimming pools, Yoga and Ayurvedic massage centres.

Accommodation facilities for tourists at Kovalam range from five star hotels to budget hotels and the choice of food
available at restaurants and cafeterias range from Continental varieties to South Indian delicacies.

Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, is just 16 km away from Kovalam and getting there is no hassle.
But if you are on holiday it is better to stay in Kovalam and visit the city. The city of Thiruvananthapuram has many
interesting places to see like the Napier Museum, the Sri Chitra Art Gallery and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.
The SMSM Institute, a State owned handicrafts emporium, is the ideal place to pick up ethnic curios and other articles.

 <h1>PUDUCHERRY</h1>
 <p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
 <h3><p>The Union Territory of Puducherry comprises of four coastal regions namely Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam.
	  Puducherry and Karaikal are situated on the East Coast of Tamil Nadu, Yanam in Andhra Pradesh and Mahe on the West
		Coast in Kerala.

The city of Puducherry is the Capital of this Union Territory. It lies on the east coast about 162 kms south of Chennai (Madras)
located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. There are no hills or forests in this region. The major soil types found
here are red ferralitic, black clay and coastal alluvial.

The main spoken language is Tamil; though Telugu, Malayalam, English and French are spoken by a considerable number of people.
Although the majority of the population is Hindu, there are quite a number of Christians and Muslims, whereas Jains, Sikhs and
Buddhists are few in comparison.

Puducherry, as many people feel, has a distinct spiritual vibration. Stories of resident sages come down throughout its
history from the earliest days. Puducherry has a special vibe, not felt anywhere else in India. It is a blend of spiritual
aura, colonial heritage, Tamil culture and the cosmopolitan flair of many nationalities in a small but varied town.
This inherent ambience of Pondy becomes most evident in the oldest part of the town which flanks the seashore boulevard.

The colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 18th century, stretch along a grid of clean straight streets which
house French institutions, Hotels, Guest Houses, Restaurants, Boutiques and private homes, including the sprawling premises
 of the famous Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Visitors to this area are greeted by mellow hues of cream, yellow, pink and grey
 compound walls interspersed by flamboyant bougainvillea bursting over gates and walls of courtyards.

<h1>PURI</h1>
<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
<h3><p>Fine white sands, roar of the breakers rolling in from the Bay of Bengal and countless devotees flocking the
	place for a purification dip are the synonyms to the Puri Beach. The beach has continued to be a sacred venue for an
	endless number of pilgrims coming to pay homage to Lord Jagannath.

With the annual Beach Festival taking place in November, the beach has now become a favorite haunt of both Indian and
foreign beach lovers. Located at a mere distance of 35 kms from the Sun Temple and 65 kms from Bhubaneshwar, the beach is
an ideal place for an introvert holiday maker for the scarcity of crowd here.

The beaches of Puri are also renowned for the sand sculptures created particularly by the internationally famed Sudarshan
Patnaik. The subjects are generally inspired by sculptures covering the temple walls, characters and episodes from the
mythology and also the contemporary events. An entire beach stretch can be completely yours given the immense number of
beaches in Orissa and a comparatively lower number of fun lovers, the city being a popular pilgrimage point for Indians.

The beach at Puri offers a unique opportunity to witness the striking sunrise and the sunset on the same beach.
Often crowded with holiday makers bathing in the afternoon, and enjoying the brightly lit kiosks in the night,
the stretches, parallel to the main Marine Drive Road, form the domain of the domestic tourists, with a row of hotels,
food stalls and kiosks selling souvenirs.

A comparatively clean and quite place for sunbathing and a relaxed swim can be found at the eastern end. Local
 fishermen easily distinguishable by their triangular straw hats and dhotis serve as lifeguards on the beach,
 and take visitors out to sea in their boats to watch the sunsets. On the Chakratirtha side, the long stretch of
 golden sand is more tranquil and pleasant place to stroll. Take enough precaution while swimming as the currents
 can be treacherous in Puri.

<h1>MANGALORE</h1>
<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
<h3><p>Ensconced on the coast, this maritime city makes a pleasant and convenient stop between Goa and Kerala. With its narrow,
	winding streets fringed with coconut palms, quaint houses with terracotta-tiled roofs, beautiful beaches, temples and
	churches, and the aroma of spicy coconut curries, it has preserved its old-world charm. Mangalore was a major seaport and
	ship-building centre in Hyder Ali's time. Today it is a business and commercial centre and Karnataka's major port for the
	 export of coffee, spices and cashew.  The Someshwar Temple overlooking a rocky promontory, the ancient 10th century Mangala
	  Devi Temple dedicated to the Goddess Mangala Devi, and the 11th century Kadri Manjunatha Temple with its exquisite bronze
		images of Lokeshwara co-exist with splendid churches and mosques. Among the more remarkable mosques are the Jumma Masjid
		in Bunder, built centuries ago by the Arabs, and the Idgah Mosque at Lighthouse Hill whose construction is attributed to
		Tipu Sultan at the end of the 18th century. The St. Aloysius College Chapel with its magnificent Biblical frescoes
		adorning the walls and ceilings is worth a peek. Equally impressive is the Shreemanthi Bai Memorial Government Museum
		with its wonderful collection of objets-de-art, archaeology, ethnology, porcelain, and wooden carvings. Nature
		enthusiasts will enjoy the Pilikula Nisagardhama, a sprawling 300-acre park, 12km from Mangalore, which has boating
		facilities, wildlife safari, mini aquariums and a science centre.
