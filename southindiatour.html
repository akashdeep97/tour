	<h1>KARTNATAKA</h1>
	<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
   <h3><p>Karnataka is a tapestry of colours, cultures, flavours, landscapes, timelessness and heart stopping beauty.
		It’s a place where vibrant worlds seamlessly meld into one another every few hundred kilometers. Sedate plains suddenly
		rise to dizzying mist covered hilly heights, and then plunge with careless abandon in a white-watered freefall to become
		languid rivers that flow past cities where time has stopped altogether. And cities where time rushes a relentless rush to
		keep up with the world; cities that sometimes escape into the deep quietude of thick forests and sometimes, stretches their
		arms wide open to embrace the sea. Host to some of India's largest and most powerful dynasties, the state has across the
		centuries, carried a legacy of art and culture. Its geography - making it, by all means, a 191,791 square kilometre trail
		of whimsy.Karnataka has hosted and continues to host a wide melting pot culture community. Along with the native Kannadigas,
		Kodavas, Tuluvas, Konkanis and several tribal sects have, across the centuries, lent colour and content to the vibrant
		culture the state calls its own. Karnataka is also home to the largest Tibetan settlement in South India. The recent past
		has seen a more inclusive populace with a large expatriate community making a beeline for the capital city of Bangalore.
		In addition to Kannada, knowing Tulu, Hindi, English, Telugu or Tamil will safely get you by. Jainism, Hinduism and
		Islam are the predominantly practised religions. But in recent times, Sikhism, Christianity and Buddhism have also found
		their place and people.

 In dance, drama, theatre, crafts, art, poetry, architecture and scholarly pursuits, Karnataka brings with it a legacy of
learning that predates the earliest dynasties. Perhaps the reason why the state, even to this date, is also home to some of the
country's best academic institutions.

<h1>BANGLORE</h1>
<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
<h3><p>South India's most alive city is Bangalore. A melting point of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, the hoi polloi is
charmingly mixed here. Nearly every one speaks English, even if it’s only a smattering, and everyone is aware of the privilege
they're bestowed with. Yes, every resident of Bangalore, regardless of where they're from, takes immense pride in their address. Malls, parks, pubs, theatre, cafes, art galleries, palaces - at any given point, Bangalore is buzzing and alive with activity. A bustling city today, Bangalore often reminisces about its days as a sleepy cantonment area of the British - tree lined avenues with quaint sounding names like Richmond Town and Victoria Layout hint that the city does get sentimental about its past. The Bangalore Palace, the Attara Kacheri (High Court), St. Mary’s Basilica, Tipu’s Palace, ISKCON Temple and the Bull
Temple highlight Bangalore’s many personalities and are monuments that mark its journey, ante-IT.
Now Bangalore is known for its thriving industry and as an IT hotbed. Lonely Planet rating the city as the No.3 destination in
the Best Travel Cities in 2012 has made Bangalore an overnight star, if it wasn’t already. Almost at the heart of South India,
this cosmopolitan city is everything a world city needs to be. Pleasant weather, pleasant people, pleasant hangouts. And for
its people, being ‘Bangalored’ has a rather affectionate tone to it.

<h1>HYDRABAD</h1>
<p><img src="images/Himachal-pradesh.jpg" style="float:left;width:500px;height:400px;" hspace="29">
<h3><p>A densely populated metropolitan city with people bustling in and out of cafes, offices, temples and even nowhere,
Hyderabad is fast turning into the new York city of South India.

Hyderabad, the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, is fast becoming the IT hub. Most tourism here is business tourism. The city's
boundaries have been extending far beyond the original city - now called the Old City - to include Secunderabad and new
developments in adjacent municipalities. The city has its fair share of history and culture which now seems to be overtaken
by the metro image with the sprawling cafes, malls and corporate buildings. Hyderabad also provides for a great gastronomical
experience for spicy food lovers.
